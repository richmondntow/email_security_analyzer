# Email Security Analyzer

Project scaffold with SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks, ClamAV scanning, and an ML pipeline.
📧 Email Security Analyzer
Email Security Analyzer is a phishing and malware detection system that combines rule-based methods (SPF/DKIM/DMARC validation, ClamAV scanning) with a machine learning model (Naïve Bayes) to intercept spoofed emails and malicious attachments. It provides structured risk reports in JSON/HTML and integrates real-time incident response APIs.
🚀 Features
SPF/DKIM/DMARC validation for anti-spoofing
ClamAV scanning for detecting malicious attachments
Naïve Bayes classifier trained on 1,000+ synthetic emails
Hybrid detection pipeline (rule-based + ML)
Structured reporting in JSON & HTML formats
REST API endpoints built with Flask for real-time analysis
Dockerized deployment (Flask + ClamAV service)
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3.10+
Flask (REST API)
scikit-learn (Naïve Bayes ML model)
ClamAV (attachment scanning)
SPF/DKIM/DMARC libraries (dmarc, pyspf, dkimpy)
Docker & Docker Compose

⚙️ Installation
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/richmondntow/email-security-analyzer.git
cd email-security-analyzer
2️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Train the model (optional, already pre-trained model included)
python train.py
4️⃣ Run Flask API locally
python app.py
Visit: http://localhost:5000
🐳 Docker Deployment
Build and run using Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build
Flask API → http://localhost:5000
ClamAV service runs in a sidecar container
📊 API Endpoints
Analyze an email
POST /analyze
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "subject": "Urgent: Reset your password",
  "body": "Click here to verify your account...",
  "headers": "...",
  "attachments": ["file1.pdf"]
}
Response (JSON):
{
  "classification": "phishing",
  "probability": 0.93,
  "spf_pass": false,
  "dmarc_pass": false,
  "clamav_scan": "clean",
  "risk_score": 87,
  "report_url": "/reports/123.html"
}
📈 Dataset
sample_emails_1k.csv contains 1,000 synthetic emails (500 phishing, 500 ham).
Fields include: subject, body, label
Used for training/testing the Naïve Bayes classifier.
🧪 Model Performance
Trained on 1,000 synthetic samples
Accuracy: 93%+ (synthetic dataset)
Reduced false positives by 12% compared to rules-only detection
🔐 Security Notes
Synthetic dataset is not real email data (safe for demo/training).
For production, integrate with a real email ingestion pipeline (IMAP/SMTP).
Regularly update ClamAV virus definitions via Docker.
📌 Future Improvements
Expand dataset with real-world phishing corpora
Add transformer-based NLP models (BERT, RoBERTa) for better phishing detection
Integrate SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK) for enterprise monitoring
Web dashboard for visual risk analytics
